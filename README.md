## Project Overview 🪙

MapSearchify is a unique world-mapping platform inspired by Snapchat. It offers real-time tracking and lightning-fast search. We've harnessed the power of Algolia, MapboxGL.js, Vue InstantSearch, NuxtJS, and TypeScript to create a dynamic and user-friendly mapping platform.

## Recommended IDE Setup ✅

For a smooth development experience, we recommend the following IDE setup:

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (disable Vetur)
- [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin)

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TypeScript 🔍

TypeScript has its limitations when it comes to type information for `.vue` imports. We've replaced the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. To enable TypeScript's language service for `.vue` types in your code editor, you'll need the [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

For faster performance, Volar offers a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669). To enable it and :

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension:
   - Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette.
   - Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right-click, and select `Disable (Workspace)`.

2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
